						My name is Anjumbanu and since the last 1.1 & half years I have been struggling with back
						pain
						& as I am a working woman, it has become a hurdle in my everyday life. We have our relatives
						in ahmedabad who gave us Dr. Nisarg’s reference. I was back on my feet within 2 days of the
						surgery and within a month i was back to my normal everyday activity. Dr. Nisarg is really
						good
						at his work and the Staff at swasti is really wonderful. I would like to share with everyone
						that
						surgery is no big deal & it is very convenient. It not only gives you your life back but
						also returns
						your lost confidence.

						I have been suffering from back pain issues since the last 5 years and during the lockdown
						it
						increased a lot, so much so that even if i’d use the loo, I would have to lay down for an
						hour to
						be able to walk again. Sitting , Standing, lifting weights all of that had become difficult
						for me.
						Based On Dr. Nisarg’s recommendation I went ahead for the surgery, and from the very next
						day post surgery , I started feeling better. I'm feeling good and I'm able to do all the
						things that I
						missed out doing earlier. Dr. Nisarg & the team are very supportive and they make sure that
						we
						recuperate well and get back to our normal lives at the earliest.

						Due to a back pain issue, I got operated few months back, the surgery was not successful &
						the
						doctor had to reoperate me again due to brain fluid discharge from the spine, my earlier
						doctor
						made me take up a lot of test , MRIs, X-rays , in spite of which I had no relief and as I
						had no
						mediclaim, being the only earning member I was financially drained. When my condition
						worsened , he asked me to undergo a third surgery. That's when my brother called me to
						Ahmedabad & we consulted Dr. Nisarg. Dr. Nisarg not only treated me at half the price of
						what
						other doctors quoted that too in a very short duration, he gave me confidence and strength
						too.
						For me he is like God, who gave me a second lease at life & I can't thank him enough.

						When I developed a back condition I consulted Dr. Parik tried to heal me without a surgery
						with
						certain injections & medication, I felt good but after 2 months the condition returned. This
						time
						we went in for a surgery and I felt alright within a day, the same evening I went to the
						washroom
						on my own and the next day I was able to walk around. Today it's been a month & i am
						perfectly
						all right. I just want to share my experience with people that science has progressed a lot

						Before the operation I was just not able to walk and my entire back was twisted. Today my
						spine
						is straight after the operation & within 8 days Dr. Nisarg made me stand up. I can walk
						straight
						now, its just been a month and 10 days, but now I can do everything. People warned us
						against
						the surgery but we are glad we took Dr. Nisarg’s help. Today I am happy about being a normal
						person. Thank you so much to the whole team of swasti.
