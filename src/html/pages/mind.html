								<p>If one suffers from persistent sadness or low mood or loss of interest in previously
									pleasurable activities for a longer duration of time, without any apparent reason,
									then it can be considered that one is suffering from Major Depressive Disorder/
									Depression. There are other signs too which indicate that one has MDD, such as:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li> Change in appetite</li>
									<li> Sleep disturbance</li>
									<li> Lethargy, tiredness without any reason</li>
									<li> Hopelessness, Helplessness, Worthlessness</li>
									<li> Suicidal thoughts/ attempts</li>

								</ul>
								<p> These symptoms are extremely disturbing and cause significant disruption in social
									and occupational functioning.<br />
									Depression is the most common cause of suicide worldwide.<br />
									Suicide is amongst the top 10 causes of death in youth all over the world.
									Depression, therefore, if suspected should be addressed and treated.

								<p>
									Just like Depression, Bipolar Mood Disorder (BMD) is a mood disorder in which there
									are episodes of mood fluctuations.<br />
									Episodes can be of depression or mania/ hypomania<br />
									Mania/ hypomania is indicated by persistent cheerful/ irritable/ elated mood with
									grandiose thoughts, racing thoughts, decreased need for sleep, increased energy,
									loss of inhibitions, reckless decision making, excessive involvement in pleasurable
									activities, increased substance use/ smoking/ drinking etc.<br />
									The frequency of the episodes can vary from multiple episodes a year to one episode
									every few years.<br />
									There can be mood variations, with seasonal changes.<br />
									This is an episodic illness, with no symptoms in the inter-episodic period

								<p>There are many subtypes of anxiety disorders, the symptoms of which vary
									accordingly.<br />
									In all of the anxiety spectrum disorders, the commonly seen signs of anxiety can be:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Excessive, inappropriate, unexplained anxiety/ restlessness/ unexplainable fear
										over prolonged periods</li>
									<li>Palpitations, racing negative thoughts, butterflies in abdomen, nausea,
										increased sweating, difficulty in breathing, choking sensations, increased
										urination/ stool frequency etc.</li>

								</ul>
								<p>Some people have severe attacks of anxiety/ panic which last for a few minutes to a
									few hours. They have extreme anxiety causing fear that one might go mad/ something
									bad is going to happen/ they might be having a heart attack and might die. These
									people also rush to the emergency department suspecting a heart attack.<br />
									Some people present with unexplained bodily pains, which are non-specific, variable
									with time, associated with signs of anxiety.<br />
									Some also suffer from anxiety in specific situations like social anxiety/
									performance anxiety. <br />
									Some also have episodes of loss of awareness, seizure like symptoms, jerky bodily
									movements, excessive crying, lasting for a few minutes to hours. This may be stress
									induced and can be hysteria<br />
									Some might present with fear of having some major illness, despite all normal
									investigations and multiple doctors’ consultations. This is an anxiety spectrum
									disorder, known as hypochondriasis.<br />
									In Body Dysmorphic Disorder, there is severe anxiety related to the one’s physical
									appearance. There is a perceived idea of some body part/ appearance being
									inappropriate/ disfigured. It is a false belief or exaggerated than the
									reality.<br />
									<b>Having anxiety is a normal phenomenon for most, but if it is too frequent/ out of
										proportion and affects the performance/ functioning then it is a disorder and
										needs
										to be treated.</b>
