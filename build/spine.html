						The spine is one of the most important parts of your body. Without it, you could not keep yourself upright or even stand up. It gives your body structure and support. It allows you to move about freely and to bend with flexibility. The spine is also designed to protect your spinal cord.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						The spinal cord is a column of nerves that connects your brain with the rest of your body, allowing you to control your movements. Without a spinal cord, you could not move any part of your body, and your organs could not function. This is why keeping your spine healthy is vital if you want to live an active life.

												Low back pain is one of the most commonly encountered spine
												problems. It can involve almost all the age groups. It can arise due to any
												abnormality in
												muscles, bones, joints, ligaments or any other soft tissue. The commonest
												causes
												are:
												abnormal posture, weight lifting and lack of exercises. It can also be seen
												due to
												trauma,
												infection and in rare cases tumor.</p>
											<p>
												Back pain can be isolated to a particular area or it can be associated with
												radiating pain
												in buttocks or thighs. Acute low back pain gets resolved with analgesics,
												rest and
												some
												light exercises. In cases of chronic low back pain, there can be
												intermittent
												episodes of
												acute low back pain in between. In chronic low pain, the mainstay treatment
												is
												activity
												modification viz. avoidance of weight lifting, forward bending, posture
												correction
												and
												back strengthening exercises.</p>
											<p>
												Preventive measures like avoidance of heavy weight lifting, back exercises,
												posture
												correction especially at your workplace etc. are important for avoidance of
												back
												pain.</p>
											<p>
												Detailed assessment by a spine expert with necessary investigations is
												necessary if
												one is
												having a history of fall, fever, symptoms like weight loss or loss of
												appetite in
												addition to
												low back pain.

												Lower limb radicular pain is
												commonly known as sciatica. There is pain sensation which goes from lower
												back down
												to legs. There can be tingling, numbness or heaviness in legs in addition to
												pain.
												Lumbar
												disc herniation is the commonest cause for lower limb radicular pain.
												Symptoms can
												vary, depending upon the level and amount of disc herniation. In large disc
												herniations
												there can be weakness of muscles due to excessive pressure on the nerve
												roots.
											</p>
											<p>
												Lifting of heavy weight, sports activity, fall are common causes of disc
												herniation.
												Initial
												management consists of analgesics and rest. Spine injections can be opted in
												some
												cases
												where pain is not responding much to analgesics. In cases with major loss of
												muscle
												power, loss of control over urine/stool and long-standing disc herniations
												refractory to
												conservative management, surgery has to be opted for.

												It is a condition of narrowing of the spinal canal leading to
												encroachment and compression over spinal cord and nerves. Their compression
												gives
												rise to symptoms of back pain and neurological claudication. In neurological
												claudication, a patient feels heaviness/pain/numbness in legs after walking
												or
												standing
												for a certain period of time and gets relieved from sitting or lying down.
											</p>
											<p>
												Lumbar canal stenosis is the result of a degenerative process happening in
												discs,
												joints
												and soft tissues. Due to ageing there is often thickening or enlargement of
												these
												structures in the form of degenerated discs, osteophytes etc. which
												compresses the
												nerve roots.</p>
											<p>
												Initial treatment is always in the form of analgesics, activity modification
												and
												exercises.
												Majority of patients get relieved with these conservative measures. If not,
												spinal
												injections can be administered. In progressive or severe symptoms, where
												pain
												becomes
												intolerable on walking/standing (with deterioration in the daily activities)
												& the
												patient’s
												condition deteriorates then surgery for decompression has to be performed
												which can
												give definite relief from symptoms. In selected cases we offer the treatment
												of
												minimally
												invasive surgery.

												this term is used for degeneration seen in the spine, be it cervical/dorsal
												or
												lumbar spine. Wear and tear occurs in all parts of the body as age
												progresses and
												the
												same applies to the spine too. Degeneration in spine can involve disc,
												joints and
												other
												bony structures, muscles etc. and this is termed as spondylosis. It can be a
												result
												of a
												degenerative process of joints (seen in elderly) or due to fracture/defect
												of pars
												(seen in
												adolescents).</p>
											<p>
		
												Initial symptom is usually back pain. As the condition progresses there will
												be more
												slippage and more impingement over the nerve roots, leading to symptoms of
												neurological claudication- pain, heaviness, tingling-numbness in legs after
												walking
												and
												standing for a few minutes.</p>
											<p>
		
												Treatment part consists of analgesics, activity modification, back and core
												strengthening
												exercises initially. However, as disease progresses, symptoms can worsen and
												it can
												lead
												to disability. In this situation surgery is recommended. In surgery,
												fixation and
												stabilization of the involved vertebra is done.</p>

												Common symptoms of lumbar spondylosis are: back pain, buttock pain,
												heaviness in
												legs, restricted movements of back etc. As spondylosis progresses it can
												lead to
												spinal
												canal stenosis. This will give rise to neurogenic claudication.</p>
											<p>
		
												Treatment of spondylosis consists of activity modification, analgesics and
												back
												exercises.
												Activities like yoga, cycling, swimming, walking etc help in losing weight,
												build
												muscles
												and endurance, thus helping in reducing the intensity as well as the
												duration of the
												symptoms of spondylosis.

												In this condition there is forward slippage of the upper vertebra over

											Neck pain is becoming a common condition because of increased
											usage of mobile phones, laptops and tablets. Any activity in which downward
											movement/position of neck is required, if done persistently can put strain
											over
											neck muscles, vertebral joints and discs. Neck pain can be associated with
											other
											symptoms like shoulder pain and upper limb radicular pain.
										</p>
										<p>
											Majority of these patients are treated with analgesics, physiotherapy and
											ergonomic training. Many cases will have ups and downs and pain patterns

											Just like lumbar spine, in cervical spine
											also there can be disc herniation which can lead to radicular symptoms due
											to
											compression of the nerve root. Symptoms usually have acute onset following
											history of jerk, lifting of heavy weight or fall. Patient will have neck
											pain along
											with upper limb radicular pain in area supplied by that particular nerve
											root.
											Also, there will be tingling, numbness or sensation of weakness in arms.</p>
										<p>
											In majority cases, after confirmed diagnosis on radio-imaging studies;
											management is done with analgesics, rest, collar support and physical
											therapy.
											Majority patients become better in period of 4-6 weeks. However, if symptoms
											are severe, persistent or if there is significant loss of arm functioning;
											further
											intervention can be required. It can be in form of pain management
											procedures
											like injections or in some cases surgery.</p>

											spinal cord compression at the cervical spine region can
											give rise to this condition. Patients with this condition can present with
											symptoms like tingling numbness in hands-feet, heaviness, imbalance while
											walking, difficulty in brisk walking, difficulty in fine movements (tying
											buttons of
											clothes, lacing up shoes etc.), weakness in hand grip, weakness in leg or
											hand
											movements etc.</p>
										<p>
											There are several causes of spinal cord compression. Common causes are: disc
											herniation; thickening of ligaments, joints, discs etc. secondary to
											degeneration;
											instability of the cervical vertebra etc. the compression of the spinal cord
											causes
											changes in spinal cord which are visible on MRI as well. Once the process of
											cord
											changes starts, if compression is not relieved then damage becomes
											progressive
											and irreversible as well.</p>
										<p>
											Conservative management (medicines, physiotherapy) has role only in initial
											stages. Once there is appearance of symptoms like imbalance, weakness and
											signs of cord changes on MRI; surgery to relieve the compression becomes
											inevitable. In such cases if not addressed properly, this condition can
											progress
											and make a person wheelchair bound or can affect control over urine and
											stool.
											The goal of the surgery here will be to stop the progression of symptoms.

											What Is MISS?
										</p>
										<p>
		
											It is a technique through which surgery is performed using minimum access to the
											targeted area leading to minimal normal tissue/bone disruption and at the same time
											target oriented approach.
										</p>
										<p>
		
											How it is done?
										</p>
										<p>
		
											It can be performed via two techniques namely
											1. Tubular retractor system: where dilator is docked(placed) over desired area and
											is fixed with a flexible arm. Surgery is performed by passing instruments through
											the tube. Surgery is performed under magnification.
											2. Endoscopic technique: the principle here is the same as a laparoscopic surgery.
											Cannula is inserted over desired area through which endoscope is passed. The
											image is received on a screen and surgery is performed by passing instruments
											through the scope.
										</p>
										<p>
		
											Advantages:</p>
										<ol>
		
											<li>
												Minimal blood loss
											</li>
											<li>
												Chances of Infections are very less
											</li>
											Minimal tissue (muscle and bone) damage
											</li>
											<li>
												Less post-operative pain
											</li>
											<li>
												Faster recovery and shorter hospital stay
											</li>
											<li>
												As it is a target-oriented procedure and performed under magnification chances
												of neurological damage are less
											</li>
		
										</ol>
										<p>
		
											Disadvantages:</p>
										<ol>
		
											<li>These techniques may not be performed in certain cases because of technical
												considerations; which can be anatomical or functional.</li>
											<li>For Multilevel spine disorders Minimally Invasive can take longer time then
												usual
												leading to prolonged anesthesia time. In such cases this procedure may have to
												be avoided owing to general condition of the patient.</li>

											It is meant for cutting the bone with high precision
										</p>
										<p>
											The drill speed can go as high as 80,000 RPM and the burr tips are available in
											different
											diameters.
										</p>
										<p>
											As compared to conventional bone cutting, drill/ burr provides several advantages
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Burr tips are available in different diameters, so they can be used in different
		
												areas of spine and pathologies accordingly
											</li>
											<li>Cutting of bone is precise</li>
											<li>Diamond tipped burr not just cuts the bone, but also reduces bleeding from the
		
												cut section
											</li>
											<li>Helps in decreasing the operative time duration</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											Pitfalls
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>It has to be handled with utmost care while operating in close proximity with
												nerves. But, with skillful handling, this complication is easily avoidable. We
												have
												latest burr handle designed to provide better grip and facilitate safe use.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											Lifting of heavy weight, sports activity, fall are common causes of disc herniation.
											Initial
											management consists of analgesics and rest. Spine injections can be opted in some
											cases
											where pain is not responding much to analgesics. In cases with major loss of muscle
											power, loss of control over urine/stool and long-standing disc herniations
											refractory to
											conservative management, surgery has to be opted for.

											The ultrasonic Bone Scalpel is a tissue-specific device that allows the surgeon to
											make
											precise osteotomies (cutting of the bone) while protecting collateral or adjacent
											soft
											tissue structures. The device is comprised of a blunt ultrasonic blade that
											oscillates at
											over 22,500 cycles/second with an imperceptible microscopic amplitude.
										</p>
										<p>
											The more compliant adjacent soft tissue is not affected by the ultrasonic

										<p>
											Advantages</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Magnification leads to better identification of neural structures, making their
												handling easy and safe, reducing the complication rates significantly</li>
											<li>Illumination and magnification together lead to better identification of any

											<b>Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM)</b> or <b>intraoperative
												neuromonitoring</b> is the use of electrophysiological methods to monitor the
											functional
											integrity of certain neural structures (e.g., nerves, spinal cord and parts of the
											brain)
											during surgery. The purpose of IONM is to reduce the risk to the patient of
											iatrogenic
											damage to the nervous system, and/or to provide functional guidance to the surgeon
											and anesthesiologist.
										</p>
										<p>
											How it is done: To accomplish these objectives, a member of the surgical team with
											special training in neurophysiology obtains and co-interprets triggered and
											spontaneous
											electrophysiologic signals from the patient periodically or continuously throughout
											the
											course of the operation. Patients who benefit from neuromonitoring are those
											undergoing operations involving the nervous system or which pose risk to its
											anatomic
											or physiologic integrity. In general, a trained neurophysiologist attaches a
											computer
											system to the patient using stimulating and recording electrodes. Interactive
											software
											running on the system carries out two tasks:</p>
		
										<ol>
											<li>selective activation of stimulating electrodes with appropriate timing, and</li>
											<li>processing and displaying of the electrophysiologic signals as they are picked
												up by the recording electrodes.
											</li>
										</ol>
										<p>
		
											The neurophysiologist can thus observe and document the electrophysiologic signals
											in
											real time in the operating area during the surgery. The signals change according to
											various factors, including anesthesia, tissue temperature, surgical stage, and
											tissue
											stresses.</p>
										<p>
		
											Who are benefitted the most: patients undergoing complex spine procedures such as
											Deformity (scoliosis, kyphosis) correction ; spinal cord tumor surgeries have
											highest risk
											for postoperative neurological deficits. Using Neuromonitoring in such patients
											reduces
											such risk to greater extent.
										</p>
										<p>
		
											Disadvantages: There is no side effects/disadvantages of this system.
